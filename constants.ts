    "description": "The Hayter Harrier 56 Pro has been greatly improved for 2019 as part of Hayter’s re development of their Harrier range of petrol lawnmowers. A ''from the ground up'' approach has been taken to the range, meaning that 90% of the components have been re designed and engineered for maximum performance and comfort. As a professional mower, which will no doubt receive heavy use by landscapers and gardeners, this machine really is built to the highest standards to accommodate these demands.\n \\n<h2>What are the Features of the Harrier 56 Pro?</h2>\n \\nIt's fantastic range of features are designed to offer maximum efficiency, performance and productivity. The fixed speed auto drive means that even on inclines or when mowing large areas, fatigue levels are kept to a minimum. The mower will, in effect, pull itself along meaning there is no need to push it. The rear roller is a 2-piece ribbed steel roller which provides superb traction and will avoid marking the turf when turning. The robust front bumper provides great protection for the deck and wheels. The 80-litre grass bag will stand on end when it's full.\n \\nThe BBC (blade brake clutch) system means the blade can stop spinning but the engine will carry on running. Therefore, when moving across paths etc the blade can be stopped without the need to restart the machine. It is the world's first crank safe BBC system. The patented system will combine the advantages of a BBC system with the reassurance of a lifetime crankshaft warranty.\n \\nThe corrosion resistant cutter deck is aluminium and made to be strong and robust. It has a low weight to high durability ratio.\n \\nHayter have used aerospace technology when designing and manufacturing the deck underside and blade profile. Its design is fully optimised to offer maximum collection performance.\n \\nThe pitch angle of the cutter deck is automatically adjusted to increase airflow when the height is set to cut longer grass, thanks to the (patent pending) Vari-Pitch system.\n \\nThe cutting chamber can be cleaned out very easily with a hose pipe and a standard hose connector. Simply clip the hose onto the connector port.\n \\n\n \\n&nbsp;\n \\n\n \\n&nbsp; Brand: Hayter. Configuration: Rear Roller. Power Source: Petrol. Drive Type: Auto-Drive.

The 48 is a great mower for tackling medium to large sized lawns, it's great cutting performance and cutter deck, which has been slightly raised, mean that leaves can easily be removed from the lawn and rough area of growth tackled with relative ease. The High quality two-piece ribbed steel rear roller gives a superb striped finish to the lawn. The single height adjustment lever on the side of the main body of the mower makes changing the cutting height an extremely simple task, and the easy-wash 'washout port' will make keeping the cast aluminium cutter deck clean a simple task, as a hosepipe can be easily attached and detached using a standard hosepipe fitting.

The Versamow system means that you don't need a mulch plug, you just simply select your preferred mowing mode, via the cleverly placed single lever and away you go. The Versamow function means that there is plenty of room left in the spacious 88 litre grass bag. The Versamow system also offers a setting for leaf shredding, where leaves are recirculated until they are small enough to pass through the Versamow opening and into the bag.\n \\n\n \\nWith the new Honda Variable Speed Transmission (VST), the HRX537 VY offers brilliant driving comfort that works hand in hand with a smooth acceleration and great speed control ranging between 0 to 6 km/h.\n \\n\n \\nThe Honda exclusive Xenoy® deck will never rust, dent, or corrode. It is incredibly robust and very durable, providing a lengthy service life, and comes with a 5 year warranty.\n \\n\n \\nThe HRX 537 VY lawnmower features the blade-brake Roto-Stop system, meaning that when you take your hands off the handle, the engine will continue to run but the blades will stop. It provides complete peace of mind whilst you mow, and is one of the safest blade functions.\n \\n\n \\nThe Honda micro-cut twin blade system produces much finer clippings for an even better mulching. This system uses four cutting surfaces to cut the grass into tiny pieces that decompose quickly, to act as a fertiliser for the lawn.\n \\n\n \\nWith integrated folding handles, you don't have to worry about storage problems, as this machine will fit tidily in the garden shed.\n \\n\n \\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13870\" src=\"https://www.briantsltd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Honda-Warranty-7-years.jpg\" alt=\"Honda warranty\" width=\"316\" height=\"237\" /> Brand: Honda.

    "description": "The RMA 765 V is the ultimate cordless lawn mower for professional grounds maintenance and lawn care. Part of the STIHL AP System, operating the machine is quiet and sustainable, meaning you don’t have to worry about refuelling the machine mid-operation. The lithium-ion batteries provide the brushless electric motor with the right amount of energy required to power the powerful 2-blade mower and the synchronised blades. With a cutting width of 63 cm, the RMA 765 V delivers precise, fine cutting – no matter the terrain you are tackling.\n \\n\n \\nThe lawn mower is also fitted with an eco mode, which allows the mower to work even more efficiently by automatically adjusting the speed of the motor based on the currently required power. Before mowing, you can choose to collect the grass clippings in the 80-litre grass catcher box or simply eject the cut grass via the rear discharge system back on to the turf you are cutting. You can also retrofit the mower with a mulching kit accessory, where the fine grass particles will be evenly mulched back onto the turf in the form of a nutrient-rich mulch.\n \\n\n \\nThanks to the electric vario self-propulsion, you can adjust the speed of the mower to suit your needs. The lawn mower is made of both high-quality and durable materials. The hybrid housing consists of a robust aluminium outer shell and an inside wall made of impact-resistant polymer.\n \\n\n \\nThe cordless mower can be quickly adjusted thanks to the option to adjust the cutting height from 25 to 100 mm at each wheel and the foldable and height-adjustable mono-comfort handlebar. Features such as the cushioned super soft grip on the handlebar and the swivelling front wheels allows the mower to be manoeuvred with ease. You can also easily transport, store or clean the mower thanks to its foldable handlebar.\n \\n\n \\nUsing the lawn mower on speed setting 3 (3.5 km/h), you will have a battery range (in m²) of up to:\n \\n<ul>\n \\n <li>AR 2000 L = 2050 m² / 54 mins</li>\n \\n <li>AR 3000 L = 3100 m² / 80 mins</li>\n \\n <li>2x AP 300 S housed in ADA 700 = 800 m² / 22 mins</li>\n \\n</ul> set type: excludes Battery & Charger, Kit - includes AL500 Charger & AR3000L Battery.

    "description": "The Honda Miimo Robotic Lawn Mowers means that, when it comes to grass cutting, there's no need to be involved at all because it intelligently follows the layout of the garden, quietly and finely cutting the grass, so there are no unsightly clippings left behind. It’s so smart it even knows when to recharge itself!\n \\n\n \\nMiimo, like many robotic lawn mowers, works on the principle of a docking station plugged into your homes electricity supply via a conventional 3 pin plug. From the docking station, we either bury or peg a boundary wire into the lawn. The docking station sends a signal through the boundary wire which Miimo detects through receiver sensors built into the mower, so it knows where to stop and turn round, avoiding any possibility of it driving off into the sunset ... or your flower beds! Once Miimo detects it has been cutting for a set period of time or the battery level is depleted, it will find the boundary wire and return itself back to it's docking station to recharge.\n \\n\n \\nFollowing installation, Miimo knows the area of the lawn it is cutting and programmes in a schedule of mowing hours across the week. It will come and go throughout the week leaving a beautifully even and well manicured finish to the lawn.\n \\n\n \\nWhen the weather gets too cold for the grass to mow, Miimo knows! It parks itself up, either until the temperature warms up sufficiently or you pack it away in the garage or shed for the winter.\n \\n\n \\n<strong>SUPPLIED WITH:</strong> 200m boundary wire and 200 pegs\n \\n\n \\nIf you reside in our local area we offer a free, no obligation consultation to assess the garden and make recommendations, thereafter we can install the Miimo and offer a full after sales service.\n \\n\n \\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14627\" src=\"https://www.briantsltd.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Honda-warranty-5.jpg\" alt=\"Honda warranty 5\" width=\"143\" height=\"237\" />\n \\n\n \\n&nbsp;\n \\n\n \\n[embed]https://youtu.be/dRHKvbMNd2s[/embed]",
